# Symfony Flex Recipes

This repository is hosting Symfony Flex Recipes for Shopware 6. If you are new to Symfony Flex, please read the [blog post](https://www.shopware.com/en/news/shopware-goes-symfony-flex/).

## Contributing

Each recipe is a directory containing a `manifest.json` file. The `manifest.json` file contains the recipe metadata and the list of files to copy.

You can look into the [Symfony documentation](https://github.com/symfony/recipes#creating-recipes) for more information about the recipe format.

The `shopware/platform` package is automatically updated by the CI. Change only the `core`, `administration` packages.

## Migrating an existing application to Symfony Flex
