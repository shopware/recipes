  * <fg=blue>Setup</>
    This recipe has created a <comment>docker/Dockerfile</comment> with an example file to build a Shopware Docker image.
    You can build it with <comment>docker build -t <name> -f docker/Dockerfile .</comment>.
    Make sure you run `./bin/console system:generate-jwt-secret --use-env` and added the private and public key to the environment file, otherwise the Administration won't work anymore.
    See https://github.com/shopware/docker for the complete documentation to configure things.
